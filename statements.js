// JavaScript Programs
// A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

// In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

// A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

let x, y, z;
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y; 

console.log("The value of z is" + z + ".");

// JavaScript Statements
// JavaScript statements are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

console.log("Hello Dolly");


// Semicolons ;
// Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

// Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:

// Examples

let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables
a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a
b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b
c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c

console.log(c);

// When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:

let d, e, f;
d = 5; e = 6; f = a + e;

console.log(f);

// JavaScript White Space
// JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

// The following lines are equivalent:

// let person = "Hege";
// let person="Hege";

// A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):

// let x = y + z;

// JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
// For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

// If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:

// JavaScript Code Blocks
// JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

// The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

// One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:
